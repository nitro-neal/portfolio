  Created a site that allows one to rate an advisor. Advisor profiles are generated dynamically from university data.
  Students can rate their advisor and give feedback. Advisors can use a magic link to log in without actually creating a user name and
  an advisor can update their profile. An admin page is also built so that the admin can approve and remove comments.
