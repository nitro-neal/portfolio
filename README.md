  My portfolio website
</h1>

Built with React, Gatsby and animated with React Spring.

## ðŸš€ To start

1.  **Yarn**

    I used yarn as my package manager. Use the yarn command in the terminal to install all dependencies.

    ```sh
      cd portfolio/
      yarn
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Start using the yarn start command. I've also added a "yarn pull-content" command if you have made updates on the CMS this will pull down the content changes and refresh the cache, avoiding issues with gatsby-image.

    ```sh
    yarn start
    ```

    or

    ```sh
    yarn pull-content
    ```
